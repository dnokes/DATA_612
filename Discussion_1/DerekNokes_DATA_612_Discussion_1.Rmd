**Please complete the research discussion assignment in a Jupyter or R Markdown notebook. You should post the GitHub link to your research in a new discussion thread.
Now that we have covered basic techniques for recommender systems, choose one commercial recommender and describe how you think it works (content-based, collaborative filtering, etc.). Does the technique deliver a good experience or are the recommendations off-target?**

```{r setup, include=FALSE,echo=F}
library(tint)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
# invalidate cache when the package version changes
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, format='latex',cache.extra = packageVersion('tint'))
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```

# Introduction

Of the services that I use that come packaged with recommendations, Spotify is - by far - the most effective at producing recommendations that I find useful. This effectiveness has motivated my search for information over the years about how they produce such great recommendations.

Spotify - the most popular global audio streaming subscription service - operates in 79 markets, has 217 million users (including 100m paid subscribers), and streams a catalog of 50+ million tracks. Spotify's user by track matrix is simply enormous. Not only that, but there are also 3+ billion user-created playlists on the platform - a goldmine for information about what Spotify's users like.

Employees of Spotify have publicly discussed aspects of the inner workings of their recommendation platform over the years, so there is some information about how the system works. Although their recommender continues to evolve, from what I can glean from publicly available information, they use a ensemble of at three types of recommenders (as-of last 2015):

## 1. Collaborative Filtering (CF)

From what I can gather, Spotify initially only used Collaborative Filtering (CF) to provide recommendations. This approach, which is outlined in the paper, Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets (http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf), has been presented at a handful of meetups over the years. Chris Johnson, formerly of Spotify, has even published a Python implementation of implicit matrix factorization (https://github.com/MrChrisJohnson/implicit-mf).

![Matrix Factorization with Logistic Loss](F:/Dropbox/github/DATA_612/DATA_612/Discussion_1/LogisticLoss.PNG)

Essentially, matrix factorization is applied to a binary representation of user/track preference where each element of the matrix represents whether a user has streamed a track. (Details can be found here https://www.slideshare.net/MrChrisJohnson/algorithmic-music-recommendations-at-spotify/19-Implicit_Matrix_Factorization19Replace_Stream_counts). The output of the method is a lower dimensional representation the universe of users and tracks. Each user has a vector that uniquely represents their musical preferences (i.e., it maps them to this space).  An approximate nearest neighbors implementation is then used to search for similar users/items to get fast recommendations for each user (https://www.slideshare.net/erikbern/approximate-nearest-neighbor-methods-and-vector-models-nyc-ml-meetup). A Python implementation is again available (https://github.com/MrChrisJohnson/annoy)

## 2. Content-Based Filtering using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is applied to meta data associated with playlists.

## 3. Content-Based Filtering using Song Audio Files
This part of the system does Deep Learning on Audio files to learn latent embeddings for users and items, using implicit user/track feedback data. The network takes as input a user's history of implicit ratings (i.e., whether they stream a track for longer than a minimum time) and attempts to predict their listening history (approximately 2 weeks).

# Software

This discussion post was created using base R [@R-base] and the R markdown [@R-rmarkdown], tint [@R-tint], kableExtra [@R-kableExtra], and tidyverse [@R-tidyverse] libraries.

```{r bib, include=FALSE,eval=T}
# create a bib file for the R packages used in this document
knitr::write_bib(c('base', 'rmarkdown','tidyverse','tint','kableExtra'),
